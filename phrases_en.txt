You're looking at the time, aren't you?
It's time to shut down the computer.
So, please switch off the PC.
Is what?
I will remind you almost every hour.
The time has long since passed.
What about the break?
It's time to take a break.
How long do you want to play?
So, it's time. 
When do you go to bed?
Are you ready yet?
Have you brushed your teeth yet?
How much longer will it take?
Please turn off the computer and go to sleep.
Hello, look at the clock.
Take a break, please.
What's up?
So, what do we do now?
